# MacAvity Emacs packages

All elisp packages are in the `lisp` folder; `config` contains sample
code for loading them in your `~/.emacs` file.

## Objective-C

Objective-C support is provided by the following files:

 * lisp/ma-objc.el -- file including all the other obj-c packages
 * lisp/ma-objc-custom.el -- Objective-c-related customisations for
   emacs builtin parameters (no new functions defined here).
 * lisp/ma-objc-xc.el -- interacting with Xcode, IB and xcodebuild.
 * lisp/ma-objc-utils.el -- utility functions for inserting ivars, methods,
   accessors, etc.
 * lisp/ma-objc-dox.el -- automatic insertion of doxygen comments.
 * lisp/ma-objc-common.el -- auxiliar functions used by the above packages;
   don't load it directly.

To load all packages you just need `(require 'ma-objc)`. See
`config/ma-objc.el` for additional customisation.
